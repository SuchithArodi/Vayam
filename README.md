Who We Are: College students for a Cause
We are a group of six students at the National Institute of Engineering, Mysore, Karnataka, who aim to increase awareness of charitable organizations and societies among the public and inspire our fellow students to take up causes that benefit the society.

What We Do: Provide a platform for networking and information dissemination
Through Vayam, we provide an online platform that connects 30 charitable organizations in Mysore with the people. Our focus is on those organizations which do not have the technical expertise or financial means to build one.

Why We Do: With knowledge comes power, with power comes effect, with effect comes change
We believe that the future of charitable causes rests with the youth of today. Hence, our objective is to provide easy access to useful information so as to raise awareness, inspire people, and provide knowledge of ways in which the common man can contribute to the cause.
